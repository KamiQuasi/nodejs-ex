See code below: public boolean login() throws LoginException { try { NameCallback cbName = new NameCallback(\"Enter username\"); PasswordCallback cbPassword = new PasswordCallback(\"Enter password\", false); // Get the username and password from the callback handler callbackHandler.handle(new Callback[] { cbName, cbPassword }); username = cbName.getName(); } catch (Exception ex) { log.error(\"Error logging in\", ex); throw new LoginException(ex.getMessage()); } MethodExpression mb = Identity.instance().getAuthenticateMethod(); if (mb==null) { throw new IllegalStateException(\"No authentication method defined - please define <security:authenticate-method/> for <security:identity/> in components.xml\"); } try { return (Boolean) mb.invoke(); } catch (Exception ex) { log.error(\"Error invoking login method\", ex); throw new LoginException(ex.getMessage()); } } In both instances where a LoginException is thrown, only the message is passed to the constructor of the LoginException. I know that the LoginException does not overload the constructor to pass a cause directly but we can use the initCause method instead: LoginException loginException = new LoginException(); loginException.initCause(originalException); throw loginException; If people use typed exceptions in their authenticator method to express different reasons why the login attempt failed, it's impossible right now to get that original exception. #2 The default behaviour of the isLoggedIn method in the Identity class is to pass the attemptLogin flag to true. Because of that, when authentication fails, it always calls the authenticator method twice. See the code of the authenticate() method below: public void authenticate() throws LoginException { // If we're already authenticated, then don't authenticate again if (!isLoggedIn()) { authenticate( getLoginContext() ); } } public boolean isLoggedIn(boolean attemptLogin) { if (!authenticating && attemptLogin && getPrincipal() == null && isCredentialsSet() && Contexts.isEventContextActive() && !Contexts.getEventContext().isSet(LOGIN_TRIED)) { Contexts.getEventContext().set(LOGIN_TRIED, true); quietLogin(); } // If there is a principal set, then the user is logged in. return getPrincipal() != null; } public void authenticate(LoginContext loginContext) throws LoginException { try { authenticating = true; preAuthenticate(); loginContext.login(); postAuthenticate(); } finally { authenticating = false; } } The first reference to isLoggedIn tries to log the user. When it fails, it goes in the if block and tries to authenticate the user for a second time before failing again. I could fix this on my end by overriding the isLoggedIn() method in my own Identity component and passing the attemptLogin flag to false. Before doing so, I thought that perhaps a fix could be done at a higher level, i.e. in the Identity class of Seam itself. The way I see it, 2 things could be done: 1. In the authenticate() method, invoke the isLoggedIn method with false. 2. Look into the management of the authenticating class member; there might be something wrong. It's only set to true at the beginning of the authenticate(LoginContext) method. If you look at the logic in the isLoggedIn(boolean) method, when it winds up being invoked at the beginning of the authenticate(), the authenticating flag is false, the attemptLogin flag is true, I don't have a principal yet (I'm trying to login for the first time) and my credentials are set (the user just provided his username and password).

Last night I made an important announcement that I would like to share. It is in bold at the link: http://www.myuniportal.com I wanted to thank the Wildfly team since the one major reason I switched it was they are using undertow. So the obvious question by all is how. I started really getting into performance over 10 years ago. Last time I checked many years ago it had over 100,000 views. So I continued my efforts over the years and each year I set a new performance goal. 10msec, 5mec 1ms ect. I am not your usual engineer. I have nearly 10 years hardware design experience, 15 years software experience and 5 years performance engineering experience that usually went into early morning hours. I believe in using engineering tools, review production reports, read log files and love to solve problems related to performance and stability. I am a known innovator and have received the highest awards (JavaOne Dukes award and others) for it. I know and stress the difference between fix and root cause. I am a engineer who really cares about the infrastructure people and the customers/users. So it took 10 years and a lot of experience and out of the box thinking to get the numbers I mention on my web site. It is real. So what was achieved has very important security aspects. DOS is one of them. I will not give a straight answer but your Security and System Engineers should be jumping up and down with pure happiness after reading what I wrote.

Firstly I had a successful junit test running in an OpenEJB container.

Then using the UserTransaction I could either commit or rollback the changes made on the jboss server by the EJB call , from the client. No problem. However the very same code does not work when my client code sits inside another Jboss (4.2.3) Container. A snippet of my client code and investigation is given below. Properties properties = new Properties(); properties.setProperty(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, \"org.jboss.naming.NamingContextFactory\"); properties.setProperty(Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES, \"org.jboss.naming.client:org.jnp.interfaces\"); properties.setProperty(Context.PROVIDER_URL, \" someIpAddress :1099\"); Context ctx = new InitialContext(properties); userTx = (ClientUserTransaction) ctx.lookup(\"UserTransaction\"); // now do userTx.begin(), userTx.rollback(), userTxCommit() etc..

I can see through the jmx console that ClientUserTransaction appears to be avialable in the jndi tree just as I have looked it up from OpenEJB without Issue.

We're currently developing a webapplication using: Richfaces 3.2.1 Facelets 1.1.14 And JSF 1.2 Background: A big part in the decision to use richfaces was that we needed a Ajax framework for performance issues.

I have read that you can do a jndi lookup on the UserTransaction object on the remote server and this will return a UserTransaction which you can begin, commit and rollback etc, The remote server EJB will inherit the transactional context, and \"hey presto\" you have a distributed transaction. This works fine when the Controlling server hosting the EJB starting the transaction is OpenEjb and the Server we are getting the UserTransaction object from is (obviously) Jboss. But when both servers are Jboss it doesn't work. Bith Client and Server in this case are running on Jboss 4.2.3GA The Client an EJB has some code like. properties.setProperty(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, \"org.jboss.naming.NamingContextFactory\"); properties.setProperty(Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES, \"org.jboss.naming.client:org.jnp.interfaces\"); properties.setProperty(Context.PROVIDER_URL, \"147.10.251.149:6299\"); Context ctx = new InitialContext(properties); ClientUserTransaction userTx = (ClientUserTransaction) ctx.lookup(\"UserTransaction\"); This all works fine within an OpenEjb container, we can use userTx as a org.jboss.tm.usertx.client.ClientUserTransaction to begin, rollback and commit. and it will do so on any remote calls to EJBs . The problem however the very same code does not return a org.jboss.tm.usertx.client.ClientUserTransaction object when run in another Jboss server, it returns a different implementation of a UserTransaction (org.jboss.tm.usertx.client.ServerVMClientUserTransaction) which does not work, and has no effect on the transactional context of calls to remote EJBs It seems like when we call lookup Usertransaction it somehow determines what type of caller you are and returns a different object.

Maybe someone can help me out a little bit. I have the current scenario, that I´m running a client-server-seam-application using hibernate 3 together with Spring 2.5. The persistence-context is NOT set to extended, but the Seam-managed PC is used. As usually in client-server-environments, the client asks for an object using a service. Let´s say he asks for a user. An user-entity will be returned using Hibernate. After the user-entity has left the server it will be detached from the hibernate-session, which is okay for me. Now let´s say I changed something on the user-entityand would like to send the update to the server. When this user-entity is returned to the server again, it is still unmanaged. So far so good. Now I´m always asking myself how to reattach this entity to the session again. In many of my services I perform some actions on the entity, before I think it is okay to merge the changes to the database. Let´s say the user has a collection of usergroups and I would like to iterate through this collection before. As this entity is unmangaged I get a LazyInitializationException which is totall understandable in this situation, but what can I do in this situation to prevent this Exception? So I wonder which is the correct way to go now? Do I have to merge the entity as a first step, everytime it is returned to the service? But what, if I realize, that the entity is not as I expect it at a later step in my service? Do I have to roll back the transaction through throwing an Exception to prevent the merge? I can´t imagine that I would have to fetch the object again in the service and would have to transferr all changes to this object myself, would I? Furthermore everytime I merge the session, a new object will be returned. So there´s always a difference between the object I received from the client and the object I´m working with and possibly the client´s object does not have the correct data. So to be sure I would always have to refetch the entity after calling the service. But this sounds a bit strange to me and I wonder if this is the way to go. As I´m probably not the first one using hibernate in a client-server-environment there have to be a lot of solutions around. So maybe someone can tell me, how to proceed in those cases as I´m a little bit los right now.

Event though the entity-Manager did not throw an exception while calling persist, I get an org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException afterwards. This leads to two problems: 1. How is it possible, that the EntityManager does not throw an exception in that case? Because if there are no problems while persisting to the database I keep on going in my code and trust in an successfull flush to the database as I cannot react on any Exception that occur later on 2. How is it possible, that the sequence in the batch-update is not as it is supposed to be? In my case the batch-updates tries to insert an entity, that is dependand on another entry (mapped through the annotations), which is not inserted yet and leads to an violation of a foreign key constraint. As I cannot change the foreign-key constraint, because I´m working on an existing database, I have to rely on the mechanism of the EntityManager and that the EM checks all possible constraint.

Therefor a CREATE-DROP in the persistence manager would not be very suitable as well, as I want to prevent hibernate from doing the mapping everytime. I tried doing it through the Hibernate Criteria-API, fetching all java.lang.Objects and performing a session.delete(object) on every object, but this leads to a not-null or transient object exception, although I did it in one transaction with setting the flushMode to \"commit\". The other way I tried was doing this through HQL, but this leads to the problem, that I´m working with @CollectionOfElements which I cannot reference through hql (or at least I haven´t found a way to do it), but the HQL does explicitly no cascades.
